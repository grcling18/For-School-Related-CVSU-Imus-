    <p>Before, I didn’t know anything about coffee,I just thought it was one basic flavor that people drank to stay awake. 
    But when I started working at Hosanna Café, I realized that coffee is so much more than that. 
    I learned that it’s not just something you make; it has different origins, stories, and flavor profiles depending on where the beans come from and how they’re prepared. 
    Working there opened my eyes to the craft behind every cup, and it made me appreciate the process and passion that goes into it. 
    Now, coffee isn’t just a drink for me it’s something I genuinely enjoy learning about</p>
    
    <li>Wearing Dress</li>

    <p>I love wearing dresses not just because it’s part of what we wear in my religion, but because I genuinely enjoy it. 
        There’s something about wearing a dress that makes me feel confident, soft, and beautiful. It reminds me of who I am as a woman someone gentle but strong, someone who’s not afraid to feel things deeply. 
        Sometimes, when I wear a dress, I feel like a woman who’s allowed to be vulnerable, someone who wants to be cared for and have someone to lean on. 
        It’s more than just clothing it’s how I express myself and embrace the kind of femininity that feels true to me.</p>

    <li>Watching Sunsets</li>

<h3>Family</h3>
    <ul>

    <p>Since I was in elementary, my mother has been working abroad as an OFW to support our family. Even though she is far from us, she never fails to show her love and care through her messages and calls. Her sacrifices inspire me to study hard and be strong.</p>
    <p>While my father was alive, he took care of us with so much love and patience. Even though he was working, he always found time for us and made sure we were safe and happy. He taught me many lessons about life and responsibility.</p>
    <p>Last year, my father passed away because of an illness. It was one of the hardest times for our family, but his memory continues to live in our hearts. I know he is still watching over us. My mother and I continue to move forward, carrying his love and the values he taught us.</p>
